- ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! 

 I'm Florencia, FullStack MERN & Mobile App's developer, I'm also a Social Communicator and Tattoo artist.

 A few months ago I decided to change my career path and dive into the IT world, so I joined the FullStack MERN Bootcamp offered by Mindhub (+700hs) where we simulate a real work environment in which we develop various projects using agile/scrum methodologies and "Learning by Doing" and I learned technologies such as: HTML - Css - Javascript - MongoDB - Express - React - Node.Js - React Native.

 I carried out projects both in web application development and mobile application development with React Native. It was a great challenge that I solved efficiently thanks to my experience, my communication skills, my commitment and responsibility that characterize me.

 During the Bootcamp, in addition to technical learning, I was able to know my soft skills and I discovered that I am responsible with the projects I take on, personal or group. I am attentive, perseverant, constant and I like to learn constantly.

 ðŸ‘‰ I am looking for a job where I can continue to contribute my knowledge and where I can continue to learn. 

Shall we have a coffee?

I invite you to visit my GitHub, where you will find my next and last works ðŸ’ª
